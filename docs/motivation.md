# Project Motivation

Food spoilage due to improper ripeness assessment causes significant
economic loss and nutritional waste, particularly in perishable fruits.
Bananas are among the most consumed fruits worldwide and exhibit rapid
ripeness transitions, making timely decision-making critical.

This project explores **computer vision–based banana ripeness detection**
as a low-cost, scalable, and explainable alternative to manual inspection.
By enabling automated ripeness classification and shelf-life estimation,
the system supports better consumption planning, storage decisions,
and waste reduction.

The broader motivation extends beyond bananas. This work establishes
a reusable computer vision research framework that can be applied to
agriculture, health, fitness, and activity understanding tasks.
