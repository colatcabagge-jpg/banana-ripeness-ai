# Dev Journal

## 2026-01-24 — Project Bootstrap
- Setup Python 3.9.5 virtual environment
- Installed core libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV, Streamlit, etc.)
- Downloaded Banana Ripeness dataset from Kaggle
- Implemented baseline training (MobileNetV2 transfer learning)
- Created Streamlit app skeleton
- Initialized Git + pushed private GitHub repo

Notes:
- Local training crashed due to RAM load. Will optimize batch size and caching.
