# CVLAB FAILURES & LESSONS LOG

(Every meaningful failure becomes system intelligence)

Purpose:
Failures are not setbacks.
They are long-term stability training data.

This file ensures:
No repeated mistakes.
Better decisions over time.
More stable system evolution.

If a failure is not logged, its lesson is lost.

# INITIAL SYSTEM LESSON

Date: System Initialization Phase

Failure Title: Risk of system drift & AI context loss
What Happened:
Long chats and new sessions can cause context loss and confusion.

Root Cause:
No persistent memory structure previously existed.

Fix Applied:
Created CVLab Memory Core with permanent structured files.

Lesson Learned:
All long-term systems require persistent memory outside chat.

Prevention Rule:
All major context must be stored in memory core.

Date: System Initialization Phase

Failure Title: Risk of premature automation
What Happened:
Desire to automate everything early could destabilize system.

Root Cause:
Automation before stable workflow understanding.

Fix Applied:
Manual-first rule enforced in system rules.

Lesson Learned:
Automation must only follow stable understanding.

Prevention Rule:
No heavy automation before stable core established.

Lesson Learned:
Resume-friendly systems prevent procrastination and confusion.

Prevention Rule:
Always update current_state before ending major sessions.
