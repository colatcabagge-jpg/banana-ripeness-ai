# CVLAB OPERATING RULES (PERMANENT)

These rules ensure that CVLab remains stable, clear, and reliable
over many years of evolution.

They are non-negotiable unless intentionally revised.

---

## 1. STABILITY FIRST RULE

System stability is always more important than speed.

No feature, automation, or experiment may be added if it risks:

* system clarity
* reproducibility
* recoverability
* structural cleanliness

When in doubt:
Choose stability.

---

## 2. MANUAL-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

CVLab follows manual-first development.

Meaning:

* Understand before automating
* Verify before integrating
* Build slowly and correctly
* Automate only proven stable workflows

Premature automation is forbidden.

---

## 3. APPROVAL BEFORE INTEGRATION

No major change may enter core system without:

1. Clear proposal
2. Design discussion
3. Review by main brain (ChatGPT)
4. Approval by system owner
5. Controlled integration
6. Logging into memory core

This prevents system corruption and drift.

---

## 4. MEMORY IS SOURCE OF TRUTH

The memory core is the permanent brain of CVLab.

All important items must be recorded:

* decisions
* failures
* architecture changes
* direction changes
* major improvements

If it is not recorded, it does not exist.

---

## 5. FAILURE LOGGING RULE

Every significant failure must be logged:

* what failed
* why it failed
* fix applied
* lesson learned

Failures are system training data.
They increase long-term stability.

---

## 6. RESUME FRIENDLY DESIGN

CVLab must always support:
Stopping work for weeks → returning without confusion.

Current state must always be clear:

* active project
* current phase
* next step

No session should end without state clarity.

---

## 7. NO BLIND AI EXECUTION

AI suggestions must always be:

* reviewed
* understood
* approved

No automatic execution of large changes.
No blind trust in generated code.

Human authority remains final.

---

## 8. KEEP SYSTEM LIGHTWEIGHT

System must run comfortably on modest hardware.

Avoid:

* unnecessary heavy background processes
* constant AI execution
* resource-heavy automation

Efficiency and responsiveness are priorities.

---

## 9. ORGANIZED GROWTH ONLY

Every addition to CVLab must:

* fit architecture
* be documented
* remain reversible
* maintain clarity

Random scripts and messy experiments are not allowed in core.

---

## 10. LONG-TERM THINKING

CVLab is a multi-year system.

All design decisions must consider:

* future scalability
* maintainability
* clarity after long breaks
* usefulness for career and income

Short-term convenience must never damage long-term structure.
