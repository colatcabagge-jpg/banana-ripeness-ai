# CVLAB DECISIONS LOG

(All major decisions are recorded here)

Purpose:
Prevent repeated thinking, confusion, and direction drift.
Every important decision must be logged with reasoning.

If a decision is not recorded, it does not exist.

# INITIAL CORE DECISIONS

Date: System Initialization Phase

Decision Title: CVLab becomes long-term engineering OS
Context:
Need for stable, structured environment for multi-year growth.

Options Considered:

1. Treat as normal project
2. Build as long-term OS

Final Choice:
Build as long-term personal engineering operating system.

Reason:
Prevents chaos, supports career growth, enables reuse and stability.

Impact:
All development now structured and long-term oriented.

Future Revisit Needed:
No

Date: System Initialization Phase

Decision Title: Stability prioritized over speed
Context:
System intended for multi-year use.

Options Considered:

1. Fast automation-heavy build
2. Slow stable build

Final Choice:
Slow, stable, controlled evolution.

Reason:
Prevents system collapse and confusion over time.

Impact:
All features must pass stability check before addition.

Future Revisit Needed:
No

---

Date: System Initialization Phase

Decision Title: Manual-first development
Context:
Avoid premature automation and instability.

Options Considered:

1. Early heavy automation
2. Manual-first then automate stable parts

Final Choice:
Manual-first approach.

Reason:
Ensures deep understanding and prevents fragile automation.

Impact:
Automation added only after workflow proven stable.

Future Revisit Needed:
No

Date: System Initialization Phase

Decision Title: Fully autonomous system as long-term goal
Context:
Owner wants eventually self-organizing engineering workspace.

Options Considered:

1. Keep semi-manual permanently
2. Gradually evolve toward autonomous system

Final Choice:
Gradual evolution toward fully autonomous system.

Reason:
Balances stability now with powerful future capability.

Impact:
System designed to support safe autonomy later.

Future Revisit Needed:
Yes (after stable core complete)

Date: 2026-02-07 22:46
Decision Title: Session Progress Update
Context: Normal working session
Final Choice: Continued system progress
Reason: creating start close cvlab files 
Impact: System evolution ongoing
Future Revisit Needed: No
