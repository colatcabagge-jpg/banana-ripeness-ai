# CVLAB LIVE CURRENT STATE (DYNAMIC NAVIGATION CORE)

This file is the active navigation brain of CVLab.
It always reflects present state + near future direction.

It must stay clear, minimal, and truthful.

Updated whenever:

* session ends
* direction changes
* phase changes
* major progress occurs

---

# 🟢 ACTIVE PRIMARY PROJECT

Banana Ripeness Detection AI (CVLab Stage 1 Flagship)

---

# 🔵 CURRENT PHASE

Real-world model accuracy stabilization

Goal:
Model must work reliably on real phone images
under different lighting and backgrounds.

This is the foundation before any advanced features.

---

# 🔴 CURRENT ACTIVE STEP (DO THIS NEXT)

Begin structured real-world dataset collection.

Capture banana images with:

* multiple lighting conditions
* different backgrounds
* different ripeness stages
* phone camera realism

Target:
200–300 real images minimum.

Do not rush training before dataset quality improves.

---

# 🟡 NEXT STEP AFTER CURRENT

1. Organize dataset cleanly
2. Retrain model properly
3. Evaluate real-world accuracy
4. Improve weak cases
5. Repeat until reliable

---

# 🟣 FLEXIBLE FUTURE ROADMAP (DYNAMIC)

These may shift based on progress.

1. Achieve stable real-world accuracy
2. Build reliable retraining workflow
3. Finalize portfolio-ready version
4. Extract reusable CV project template
5. Add multi-banana detection later (YOLO)
6. Convert CVLab into reusable system
7. Prepare second major CV project
8. Build freelance-ready delivery structure
9. Multi-project CVLab support
10. Gradual automation integration

This roadmap evolves intentionally.

# 🧠 SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTES

(Tracks how thinking and direction evolve)

System just initialized as long-term engineering OS.
Memory core established.
Stability-first philosophy locked.
Automation will be gradual and controlled.

Future changes in direction must be logged here.

---

# 🧪 CURRENT SYSTEM HEALTH

Memory core: active
Architecture: stable
Workflow clarity: improving
Model accuracy: needs real data
Direction: clear
Risk level: low

---

# ⏸ IF RETURNING AFTER LONG BREAK

Read ONLY this file first.

Then open ChatGPT and say:
"Resume CVLab session"

System will continue calmly from here.

No confusion.
No pressure.
One step at a time.
