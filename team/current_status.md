# CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

## Project
Fruit Ripeness Detection (Banana)

## Current Phase
Baseline Training Stabilization

## Model
MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning, Frozen Backbone)

## Dataset
Kaggle — Banana Ripeness Classification Dataset

Classes:
- Unripe
- Ripe
- Overripe
- Rotten

---

## Current Situation
Baseline training pipeline created.

Issue:
Training overload on low RAM systems.

---

## Immediate Next Step
Run baseline training on GPU laptop (RTX system).

---

## Risks
Low RAM training instability on 8GB systems.
